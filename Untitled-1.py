'''
This dataset contains various country-level world statistics, including the rate
of internet usage and the per- person income.
• Produce a Python program which separates the dataset in two groups, one
with countries with income below 10,000, and one with countries with income
at or above 10,000
• Then, extend it to produce two histogram (distribution) plots depicting internet
usage, one for the first group of countries and one for the second group of
countries
• The output files should be called hist1.png and hist2.png
